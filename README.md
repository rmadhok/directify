# Directify

A basic python script I made to generate a folder directory for new EPoD / J-PAL projects. 

**Features**
* Generates full set of folders and sub-folders so you don't have to make 50+ folders manually. 
* Initializes git in the directory and option to write a .gitignore file

To set up:
* Create a new folder with the name of your project (e.g. test_project)
* Drop directify.py inside the folder
* Run directify.py and watch the directory form!

Note: Compatible with PC and Mac
